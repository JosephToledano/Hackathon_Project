# Hackathon_Project
The repository for the best hackathon extension the game has ever seen


#How do I get started?

click on the Fork button on the top right of the page

click on your handle to fork to your repo
Each partner clones their own newly forked repo to their local machine

first, make sure you're on your new forked repo on GitHub
copy and paste GitHub url from the right side of the page

enter the following line into your command line and insert your copied url instead of the quoted text:
git clone 'copied url'
Each partner adds two remote links to their cloned repo on their own local workstation: one to CodesmithLLC's repo, and one to the partner's repo:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/unit-1-js-fundamentals.git
git remote add partner https://github.com/PARTNERS_GITHUB_HANDLE/unit-1-js-fundamentals.git
* Make sure to edit the remote partner link with your partner's GitHub handle.

As you work remotely on your own workstation, periodically push your changes to your repo with git push origin master. Your partner can then use git pull partner master to get the changes onto their machine, followed by git push origin master to push those changes to their own GitHub repo!

Check out the GitHub Documentation for a more in-depth explanation of forking and cloning.
